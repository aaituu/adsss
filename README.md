# Java Lab: Function and Recursion

This project contains 10 small Java programs demonstrating key concepts of **functions** and **recursion**.  
Each task is written as a separate `Main.java` file and is designed to be easy to test, understand, and explain.

---

## 📚 Tasks Included

1. **Find Minimum** — Finds the minimum value in an array.
2. **Calculate Average** — Calculates the average of array elements.
3. **Check Prime** — Determines whether a number is prime.
4. **Factorial (Recursion)** — Computes factorial using recursion.
5. **Fibonacci (Recursion)** — Computes the nth Fibonacci number recursively.
6. **Power (Recursion)** — Calculates `a^n` recursively.
7. **Reverse Array (Recursion)** — Prints array in reverse order using recursion.
8. **Check Digits (Recursion)** — Checks if a string contains only digits.
9. **Combinatorics (Recursion)** — Computes `C(n, k)` recursively.
10. **GCD (Recursion)** — Finds greatest common divisor via Euclidean Algorithm.
